it makes much easier to compare the two files
so we caneaasily compare the versions to make better work results
pros: just right amount of commits cons: sometimes forgets to commit
because in git more than one file is related to another, while google docs files are usually independent
use git log to find out what kind of commit you want to look into and useing git diff to find out the actual changes btw them
you can always go back to the older version
I want to work on my app using version control with git
